# Random Number Memory Quiz

This program randomly generates three random numbers between 1 and 100. It briefly shows you the numbers before hiding them and then it asks you one of four questions; What was the highest number, what was the median number, what was the lowest number, or what was the sum of the numbers. You then try to answer the question correctly, and after ten questions you will be given a score on how many you got correct.

**Example:**

The numbers for this round are: 14 84 96
(100 blank lines)
What was the smallest number? 14
Correct.
(Repeat 10 times)
Your total score is X/10
