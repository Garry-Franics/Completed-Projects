### Task 1 - CPE

* Your properly formatted CPE:

Following the format of:

`cpe:2.3:<part>:<vendor>:<product>:<version>:<update>:<edition>:<language>:<sw_edition>:<target_sw>:<target_hw>:<other>`

`cpe:2.3:a:SecureCorp:SecureFileManager:2.1.3:beta:*:en-us:*:windows:*:*`

* Field breakdown

`cpe:2.3:` This shows that this is version 2.3 of the CPE format.

`a:` This shows that the product is an application.

`SecureCorp:` This is the name of the product vendor.

`SecureFileManager:` This is the name of the product.

`2.1.3:` This is the version number in semantic versioning (major.minor.patch).

`beta:` This is the update status. It shows the product is still in beta, which implies it is not complete and still being tested.

`en-us:` This shows the language of the product, which is US english.

`windows:` This is the target software, the software the product is designed to run on. This shows that the product is specificaly the windows version.

* Wildcards `*`

`<edition>` This would show if the CPE is for any specific version of the product. It is set to `*` to show that the product does not have any specific editions such as "free" or "premiun".

`<sw_edition>` This would show if the CPE is for any specific version of software. It is set to `*` to show that the software (windows) that the product runs on does not need to be a specific version of that software.

`<target_hw>` This would show if the CPE is for the product while being run on any specific hardware. It is set to `*` to show that the product is not for any specific hardware.

`<other>` This is where one would put any aditional information about the CPE. It is set to `*` to show that there is no relevant information to add to the CPE that doesn't fit a previous field.

### Task 2 - CWE

* Link to your top 25 CWE

[CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)

CWE-434 is also called "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type". This vulnerability is when applications allow users to upload files to its servers without properly validating the type or content of the file. This allows malicious users to upload files like executables or scripts that can then be run on the server, causing damage. In [CVE-2023-5227](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5227#cna-c09c270a-b464-47c1-9133-acb35b22c19a), there was a vulnerability where a user could upload an HTML file to the application phpMyFAQ that could then cause various effects when triggered, such as execution of code or redirection to malicious sites. There is also [CVE-2001-0901](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0901), a vulnerability in the application Hypermail where users could upload .shtml files that could then execute commands on SSI supporting servers, which could be used for code execution or for giving the user enhanced privileges.

In the SecureFileManager program, the code for uploading files failed to include any system for validating the file type that was uploaded. This allowed users to upload potentially dangerous file types, such as .exe .php and .js files. These files could then be executed inside the server leading to possible code execution, access to sensitive data, or giving the user increased permissions.

* Assign a CVSS score and defend it (why did you select what you selected in the caluclator)

CVE Writeup:

## CVE-2025-8546

### CNA: Matt Kijowski

### Description

The SecureCorp program SecureFileManager 2.1.3 (beta) has a CWE-434 vulnerability that allows for the unrestricted upload of possibly dangerous file types. The product does not validate the types of files being uploaded, allowing for potentially malicious files (.php, .exe, .js) to be uploaded onto the server and be executed. This could allow users to preform remote code executions, view sensitive data, or gain increased permissions on the system.

### CWE: 1 total

CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Root Cause:

Files are not checked for malicious extensions, allowing for code insertion and other attacks.

### Impact

Estimated Base: High

An attacker could see and alter a great deal of sensitive information if they properly use this vulnerability

CVSS data

Score: 7.5 

Severity: High

Version: 3.1

### Product Status

Vendor: SecureCorp

Product: SecureFileManager

Versions: 2.1.3 Beta

### END OF CVE

### The part where I justify the CVSS score

Attack Vector: Network

All you have to do is upload a file onto the server, you could do that from anywhere on the network.

Attack Complexity: Low

You could upload that file to the system at any time, no extenuating circumstances.

Privileges Required: Low

You need access to the file system to upload the file to begin with, so some privileges will be needed at the start.

User Interaction: None

Once you are on the network there is no need for another user to assist you in any way.

Scope: Unchanged

The attack will only affect whoever is using that server, it can't go past it.

Confidentiality Impact: High

The attacker is able to view all files on the system (depending on what they put in their attack file).

Integrity Impact: High

The attacker would also be able to modify all files on the system (again depending on what is in the attack file).

Availability Impact: None

The attack just gives access to the server, it doesn't shut it down or prevent others from accessing it. (I guess they could delete every file but thats more of an integrity thing isn't it?)

Exploit Code Maturity: Functional Exploit Exists

You send in the file, it goes into the server and does its thing. Very real in practice.

Remediation Level: Official Fix

Just make the program check the file type, done and dusted.

Report Confidence: Confirmed

This isn't a real situation so I don't know if SecureCorp is aware of their nonexistent vulnerability reports but since I made them up I'm saying they are.
